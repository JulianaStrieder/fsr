# _fsr_ Package: Handling fuzzy spatial data in R

Current version: 1.0.0

## About _fsr_

It captures the inherent
property of many spatial objects in reality that have inexact loca-
tions, vague boundaries, and/or blurred interiors, and hence cannot
be adequately represented by crisp spatial objects.

Many spatial objects (i.e., geographical objects) in reality may have inexact locations, vague boundaries, and/or blurred interiors, and hence cannot be adequately represented by well-known (crisp) spatial objects (e.g., those objects available in spatial libraries like GEOS and GDAL). Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic have been powerful approaches to deal with spatial fuzziness.

Unfortunately, spatial fuzziness has so far not found its way into spatial data science projects due to a lack of complete implementations of software packages that can handle fuzzy spatial objects. Motivated by this lack of support, the _fsr_ package has the following advantages:

- It is an implementation of the [fuzzy spatial data types, operations, and predicates](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7737976) of the [Spatial Plateau Algebra (SPA)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8491565).
- It offers the [construction of fuzzy spatial objects as spatial plateau objects](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8858878) from real point datasets.
- It has families of functions that permit users to conduct exploratory (spatial) data analysis by issuing geometric operations and topological predicates on fuzzy spatial objects.
- It provides methods for designing [fuzzy spatial inference models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8015707) to discover new findings from fuzzy spatial objects.
- It deploys algorithms to determine and only evaluate a subset of points that really contributes to finding the final but approximated answer to a userâ€™s query window inference.
